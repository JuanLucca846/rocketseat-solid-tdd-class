# SOLID + TDD Class

This project was taken from the Rocketseat youtube class, and this class covers several topics about SOLID and TDD, some of the topics are:

- **SOLID**: Principles of software design to create robust and flexible systems.

  S: Each class should have only one responsibility.

  O: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

  L: Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes.

  I: Many specific interfaces are better than a single general interface.

  D: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

- **TDD**: TDD is a software development approach in which automated tests are written before the code implementation.
